How to integrate  LLM to web app using Python, with the help of chat GPT 3.5

## background

I had an interview with a startup that wants people to build applications to use and interact with LLM and ML models. The interviewer processed to ask me an algorithm question. During the time to solve the algorithm, I kept spacing out and thought about how I can make a web app that use chatGPT in less than 3 hours. The morning after, I have an MVP product.
